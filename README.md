    TOOLS: Jupyter Notebook l Spyder l MySQL
    FE&EDA: Pandas&Numpy
    ML: Linear Regression&Random Forest Regressor
    Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Sci-Kit Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pickle

## Summary: 

### I handled columns, convert string values to integer values, missing values with PANDAS. Checked the distributions for every columns with NUMPY. I applied min_max_scaler and Linear Regression&Decision Tree by using SCI-KIT LEARN. Created a web by using FLASK,HTML AND CSS. To run home.py, your Python version must be 3.11.0
