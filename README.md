# Earthquake Prediction(ml) by using Turkey Earthquake dataset


## What is ml?

  ### The method proposed by Richter and known as the Richter scale. The magnitude of the earthquake is determined by measuring the sound waves However, this method cannot measure severe earthquakes.

    #### TOOLS: Jupyter Notebook l Spyder l MySQL

    #### FE&EDA: Pandas&Numpy

    #### ML: Linear Regression&Random Forest Regressor

    #### Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Sci-Kit Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pickle

    #### Column names [TR]: Enlem	      Boylam	Derinlik  	xM	             Final	      Mw	          Ms	          Mb	            Yil	        Ay	          Gun

## Summary: 

### I handled columns, convert string values to integer values, missing values with PANDAS. Checked the distributions for every columns with NUMPY. I applied min_max_scaler and Linear Regression&Decision Tree by using SCI-KIT LEARN. Created a web by using FLASK,HTML AND CSS. To run home.py, your Python version must be 3.11.0
